### 1.Background

The history of DBMSs development is about dealing with the limitations of hardware. The first DBMSs in
the 1970s were designed in environment with the following characteristics:

- Uniprocessor (single core CPU)
- RAM was severely limited
- Database had to be stored on disk
- Disk is slow. Seriously slow

But now DRAM capacities are large and inexpensive enough that most structured databases (gigabytes/low
terabytes) will entirely fit in memory. This merits us to rethink all aspects of the DBMS to account for this. This course is about ways to do this.

### 2.Disk-Oriented Database Management Systems

For a disk oriented DBMS, the system architecture is predicated on the assumption that data is stored in
non-volatile memory. This means that the DBMS may have to read data from disk during query execution.

In a disk-based system, only approximately 7% of instructions are for the execution of transaction logic in OLTP workloads [2]. The majority of the DBMS’s instructions time are in managing three of its key components: (1) buffer pool, (2) concurrency control, (3) logging/recovery.

#### Buffer Pool
The DBMS organizes the database as a set of fixed-length blocks called slotted pages. The system uses an in-memory (volatile) buffer pool to cache the blocks cached from disk.

- When a query accesses a page, the DBMS checks to see if that page is already in memory.

- If not, the DBMS retrieves the memory from disk and copies it into a frame in its buffer pool. A
pointer to the frame is returned for further operations.

- If there is no free frame to store the new page, DBMS finds a page to evict. If the evicted page is dirty, DBMS writes it on disk.

- Once the page is in memory, the DBMS translates any on-disk addresses to their in-memory addresses.

- Every tuple access has to go through the buffer pool manager regardless of whether that data will
always be in memory. Even if we provide the DBMS with large enough memory to store the entire database in memory, these operations still occur.

#### Concurrency Control

In a disk oriented DBMS, the system assumes that a transaction could stall at any time when it tries to access data that is not in memory.

The system’s concurrency control protocol allows the DBMS to execute other transactions at the same time
to improve performance while still preserving atomicity and isolation guarantees. Since locks are stored separately in memory, however, a DBMS spends extra time to locate lock owners.

#### Logging and Recovery

Most DBMS use STEAL + NO-FORCE buffer pool policies so all modifications have to be flushed to the WAL
before a transaction can commit [1]. Log entries contain before and after image of record modified. The
DBMS flushes WAL pages to disk separately from corresponding modified database pages, so it takes extra work to keep track of what log record is responsible for what page (e.g., LSN).
