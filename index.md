## eraft
Raft library implemented by C++, inspired by etcd golang version and pingcap tinykv

## Overview
Raft is a protocol with which a cluster of nodes can maintain a replicated state machine. The state machine is kept in sync through the use of a replicated log. For more details on Raft, see "In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm" (https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf) by Diego Ongaro and John Ousterhout.
